## **Self-supervised learning**

Self-supervised (or semi-supervised) learning is a strategy of learning that lands somewhere inbetween supervised and unsupervised learning. It involves a pretext task, having the system generate positive examples from the data through augmentation of existing data and thus creating something analogous to labels. It can then train itself on these.
