## **Bijective Functions**
The function must have a one-to-one mapping from the domain to the range. In other words every x results in a distinct and unique value for y (a circle is not bijective).
This condition is sufficient and necessary for invertibility

Can also be done by representing the functions in matrix form and finding the inverse
